## Project Name
Todo-API


## About
A simple Todo API built in Go, with a frontend component. This project implements a backend API for managing todo items and includes a basic frontend interface.


## Prerequisites
To run this project you need Go and Node.js installed on your system.
Additional libraries are required: Go modules (via go.mod in todo-api) and Node.js dependencies including Vite (via package.json in todo-frontend).


## Features
This Todo-API includes these features:

* RESTful backend API in Go for todo management
* Interactive frontend built with JavaScript and Vite
* Full-stack integration for creating, reading, updating, and deleting todos


## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/todo-API.git`


## Usage
For the backend: Navigate to todo-api and run the Go server (e.g., go run main.go or equivalent).
For the frontend: Navigate to todo-frontend, install dependencies with npm install, and start the development server with npm run dev (using Vite).


## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

* Build a backend API with Go
* Develop a modern frontend using Vite and JavaScript
* Connect frontend and backend in a full-stack application
